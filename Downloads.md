# Current version #

Te current version is version [1.1.0.0](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B99-_8O1gtpHd3VtUE5xQUhNT28). Roughly it is _the_ version that supports the thre database vendors. (MySQL Postgresql and Oracle) to store the reporting database. Totally independent of your Alfresco database.
It will support large reporting databases, harvesting time is constant (not dramatically increasing) and batch-wise fall-back is in place, so it will continue where it stopped. Also within a table.
